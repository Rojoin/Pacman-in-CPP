# Pacman-in-CPP
A simple Pacman game that i made for my final exam of "Fundamentos de la Programaci√≥n 2022" in the Image Campus institute.


There were some rules to follow for this exam, we couldn't use classes, must have the conio.h library and the console needed to be updated without the need for input from the player.
It was a fun project, although I started with Tetris and ended up making a whole different game!
